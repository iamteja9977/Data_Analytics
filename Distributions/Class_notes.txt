Probability Distribution:
---------------------------

Note that x0 and x1 are the random variables and y is the probability of these random variable. This can be 0 or 1 aka discrete values only.
This way we have 1000 entries of x0, x1 and y.
If here, x0, x1 and y are both discrete variables we can plot a 2d bar graph of x and probability of x.
This bar graph is the probability distribution of x.
There are only 2 bars on x axis, each for x0 and x1.
on y-axis, we will have probability of that event occuring (by summing the values for which y=1 for each of x0 and x1).
Also note that this is a Binary Classification problem.


Probability distribution of Continuous variable:
--------------------------------------------------

Instructor takes an example of a normal distribution:
eg: y = age of the class
It wil be a normal distribution with the mean age set at 19 and standard deviation of 2 years. (approximately)
